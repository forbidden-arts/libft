[![dpalmer's 42 Libft Score](https://badge42.vercel.app/api/v2/cli5pb141011308mh1fmi5qrq/project/2848837)](https://github.com/JaeSeoKim/badge42)  
## 🪧 Overview
This project started with remaking some of the functionality of what is normally included in the C standard libraries, but has since expanded to include common tasks that I am finding I need as the portfolio grows. Lately, I have been messing around with manipulating bits directly to see if I can max out efficiency within the context of the 42-Norm.

This project is ongoing, so please excuse the mess.
