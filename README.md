## ü§ì Overview
This project started with remaking some of the functionality of what is normally included in the C standard libraries, but has since expanded to include common tasks that I am finding I need as the portfolio grows. Lately, I have been messing around with manipulating bits directly to see if I can max out efficiency within the context of the 42-Norm.

This project is ongoing, so please excuse the mess.

## üì∑ Preview
Unfortunately, these _extremely useful_ functions are not visual at all, so there's no sexy graphics to show. Sorry.

## üíª Compilation
To compile:
```make```
Remove the object files:
```make clean```
Remove everything:
```make fclean```
